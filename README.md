# Mr Culture, The Adventures of a Cultured Culture.

This platformer was created for [Three Thing Game Nov 2017](https://threethinggame.com/post/2017-11-04-the-culture-event/)

This year, to celebrate the city of culture 2017, we all had the same three words. Culture, Hull, and Change.

## The Plan
This year we wanted to learn to use Unity. It was supposed to be easy and both of us would have to use it later in the year for courswork anyway, might as well get a head start.

We didn't have much of an idea what to make but we decided to subvert expectations and opt for a game about a culture of bacteria changing to it's enviroment on the Hull of a space ship. We took inspiration from an entry from a previous competition where a bear changed states to complete a puzzle platformer. 

So our culture of bacteria is slowed by the cold, killed by the heat and eats to grow. This gave us our basic premise from here on it was all about reading unity documentation, consuming caffine and getting a demo level together for the judges.
